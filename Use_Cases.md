# Echo Notes Use Cases

Echo-Notes isn't just for cleaning up notes. It's a modular, local-first automation system that works with synced files from **Nextcloud**, **Syncthing**, or any other tool that writes to disk.

Below are real-world workflows powered by Echo + local LLMs.

---

## 1. Voice Note to Structured Journal

**Flow**:  
Dictate quick thoughts into a voice-to-text app → synced to Echo folder → Echo cleans grammar, formats into Markdown journal entry, adds tags or todos.

**Prompt Example**:
```json
"Rewrite this voice note into a structured journal entry with headings, todos, and cleaned-up grammar. Use Markdown."
````

**Folder Tip**:
Use a `Journal/YYYY-MM-DD/` folder convention for organized output.

## 2. Weekly Summary Generator

**Flow**:
Echo collects daily journal files → generates a weekly summary with bullet points, mood indicators, and highlights.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Summarize the following 7 journal entries. Highlight mood trends, major events, and tasks to carry forward."
```

**Output**:
A single weekly `.md` file written to a `Summaries/` folder.

---

## 3. Research Digest

**Flow**:
Drop PDFs, articles, or note dumps into a `Reading` folder → Echo extracts key takeaways and writes a summary with tags.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Extract main points, arguments, and useful quotes from this article. Use Markdown with bullet points."
```

---

## 4. Idea Refinement

**Flow**:
Rough ideas or outlines dropped into a synced folder → Echo rewrites them into structured blog posts, Nostr drafts, or polished content.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Expand this outline into a 500-word blog post with an intro, body, and conclusion."
```

---

## 5. Code Snippet Commentary

**Flow**:
Save `.py`, `.go`, or `.sh` files to a watched `CodeDrop/` folder → Echo adds comments, refactors, or explains them.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Explain this code in plain English. Then suggest improvements or flag potential bugs."
```

---

## 6. Daily To-Do Extraction

**Flow**:
Capture raw daily notes → Echo extracts tasks and writes to `Todos/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Pull out any action items or todos from this note and reformat them into a checklist."
```

---

## 7. Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) Conversion

**Flow**:
Echo processes longform notes into Zettelkasten-style atomic notes, flashcards, or Q\&A pairs.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Split this note into individual concept cards with titles, summaries, and questions."
```

---

## 8. Nostr Draft Automation

**Flow**:
Write a longform note in Markdown → Echo generates short posts, threads, or tag suggestions for Nostr.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Turn this journal entry into 3 Nostr posts, each with relevant hashtags."
```

---

## 9. Mood Tracker & Emotional Tagging (WIP)

**Flow**:
Journal entries or memos → Echo scores tone/sentiment → adds metadata to frontmatter.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Analyze emotional tone. Tag this entry as positive, neutral, or negative. Add a brief mood summary."
```

---

## 10. Secure PDF Summarizer

**Flow**:
Drop privacy-sensitive PDFs (e.g. contracts, policies, research) into a folder → Echo summarizes offline, privately.

**Prompt Example**:

```json
"Summarize this document in plain English. Highlight key terms, risks, and action items."
```

## Tips for Use

* You can create multiple watch folders with different prompt configs.
* Echo is fully local, so your content stays private—no cloud processing.
* Combine with `systemd`, `cron`, or GUI Dashboard to run background jobs.
